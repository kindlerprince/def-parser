2. clone the above repository using "git clone https://github.com/HITK-Compiler/def-parser.git"
3. get inside the directory, "cd def-parser"
4. create a new branch with the name of the feature or part which you have written the code for using "git checkout -b yourFeatureName"
5. Find the location of your local copy of repository using "pwd" command, copy your code inside this folder using terminal or file manager.
